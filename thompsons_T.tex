\section{Thompson's group $T$}
Thompson's group $T$ acts on the circle $S^1$, and for any probability measure $\mu$ on $T$ there is a unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $S^1$.\red{are there any assumptions on the measure? non-degenerate probably? some moment assumption?}. The objective of this section is to prove that $(S^1,\nu)$ is not the Poisson boundary of the $\mu$-random walk on $T$. This answers a question asked in the second item of Section 6 of \cite{Deroin2013}, and which is asked again in \cite[Question 19]{Navas2018} for finitely supported, non-degenerate and symmetric probability measures on $T$.


\begin{thm}\label{thm: main thm circle Thompson}
Let $\mu$ be a non-degenerate finitely supported probability measure on Thompson's group $T$. Let $\nu$ be the unique stationary measure on the circle $S^1$ such that $(S^1,\nu)$ is a $\mu$-boundary of $T$. Then $(S^1,\nu)$ is not the Poisson boundary of $(T,\mu)$.
