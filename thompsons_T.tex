\section{Thompson's group $T$}

\begin{thm}
Let $\mu$ be a non-degenerate finitely supported probability measure on Thompson's group $T$. Let $\nu$ be the unique stationary measure on the circle $S^1$ such that $(S^1,\nu)$ is a $\mu$-boundary of $T$. Then $(S^1,\nu)$ is not the Poisson boundary of $(T,\mu)$.
