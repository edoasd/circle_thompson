\section{The conditional entropy criterion and non-maximality of a $\mu$-boundary}

The following criterion goes back to \cite[Theorem 2]{Kaimanovich1985} (see also \cite[Theorem 4.6]{Kaimanovich2000})
\begin{thm}[Kaimanovich's conditional entropy criterion] Let $G$ be a countable group and let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $G$ with $H(\mu)<\infty$. Consider a $\mu$-boundary $(X,\lambda)$ of $G$. Then $(X,\lambda)$ is the Poisson boundary of $(G,\mu)$ if and only if for $\lambda$-almost every $\xi\in X$ we have $h^{\xi}(\mu)=0$.
\end{thm}
